### Hi there!

Welcome to my blog! My name is Bhagyashree and I usually go by the name BK. I couldn't get domain for bk.codes so here I am bsk.codes! I currently work as Application Developer at a local Software company. I work both on front end as well back end of our company application and also webapps. My experience ranges from HTML,CSS, JavaScript to Oracle SQL, SQR, Shell and other scripting languages. I also got to work with Python lately which was actually the next language to learn in my list. 

I have following purposes to start this blog. 1) I will learn Gatsby and also reinforce my React knowledge. 2) I will be able to write about my Dev learning journey. 3) I love to write!

So let's see how it goes!
